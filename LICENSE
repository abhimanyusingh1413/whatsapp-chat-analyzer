# WhatsApp Chat Analyzer

This project allows you to preprocess and analyze WhatsApp chat data using Python. It provides functionalities to clean the chat data, split the messages by user and date/time, and generate various statistics about chat usage.

## Features
- Preliminary data cleaning using regular expressions
- Splitting messages into user name and message text
- Statistics on messages, words, media usage, links, and more
- Timeline generation for daily and monthly trends
- Most common words extraction with stop-word removal
- Generates WordCloud images for message summaries

## Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- pandas  
- wordcloud  
- urlextract  
- emoji  

Install these via:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Make sure you have a WhatsApp chat file (exported as text).  
2. Use the `preprocessor.py` script to clean and split your data:
   ```python
   from preprocessor import preprocess

   with open('your_chat_file.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
       chat_data = f.read()

   # preprocess the chat data
   df = preprocess(chat_data)

   # now you can analyze the df DataFrame for statistics, trends, etc.
   ```
3. Generate statistics and visualizations using the `analyzer.py` script:
   ```python
   from analyzer import generate_statistics, plot_timeline

   # generate statistics
   stats = generate_statistics(df)

   # plot timeline of messages
   plot_timeline(df)
   ```
